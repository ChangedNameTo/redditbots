RankFlair
=========

Assigns flair to posts based on their rank in a subreddit's top-of-all-time listing (ex: [/r/botwatch/top/?sort=top&t=all](http://reddit.com/r/botwatch/top/?sort=top&t=all))

A post's flair can increase in rank as the post moves upward, but it will never decrease - A post will keep the highest ranking flair it has ever achieved.

rankflair_gws is modified to be used specifically by /r/gonewildsmiles (nsfw). It was best to make a separate file out of this.
